unit Neslib.Stb.TrueType;
{< stb_truetype: parse, decode, and rasterize characters from truetype fonts.

  Simple 3D API (don't ship this, but it's fine for tools and quick start):
  * stbtt_BakeFontBitmap -- bake a font to a bitmap for use as texture
  * stbtt_GetBakedQuad   -- compute quad to draw for a given char

  Improved 3D API (more shippable):
  * stbtt_PackBegin
  * stbtt_PackSetOversampling -- for improved quality on small fonts
  * stbtt_PackFontRanges      -- pack and renders
  * stbtt_PackEnd
  * stbtt_GetPackedQuad

  "Load" a font file from a memory buffer (you have to keep the buffer loaded):
  * stbtt_InitFont
  * stbtt_GetFontOffsetForIndex -- indexing for TTC font collections
  * stbtt_GetNumberOfFonts()    -- number of fonts for TTC font collections

  Render a unicode codepoint to a bitmap:
  * stbtt_GetCodepointBitmap    -- allocates and returns a bitmap
  * stbtt_MakeCodepointBitmap   -- renders into bitmap you provide
  * stbtt_GetCodepointBitmapBox -- how big the bitmap must be

  Character advance/positioning:
  * stbtt_GetCodepointHMetrics
  * stbtt_GetFontVMetrics
  * stbtt_GetFontVMetricsOS2
  * stbtt_GetCodepointKernAdvance

  Starting with version 1.06, the rasterizer was replaced with a new, faster and
  generally-more-precise rasterizer. The new rasterizer more accurately measures
  pixel coverage for anti-aliasing, except in the case where multiple shapes
  overlap, in which case it overestimates the AA pixel coverage. Thus,
  anti-aliasing of intersecting shapes may look wrong.

  @bold(Important Concepts)

  Some important concepts to understand to use this library:

  * Codepoint: Characters are defined by unicode codepoints, e.g. 65 is
    uppercase A, 231 is lowercase c with a cedilla, $7e30 is the hiragana for
    "ma".
  * Glyph: A visual character shape (every codepoint is rendered as some glyph)
  * Glyph index: A font-specific integer ID representing a glyph
  * Baseline: Glyph shapes are defined relative to a baseline, which is the
    bottom of uppercase characters. Characters extend both above and below the
    baseline.
  * Current Point: As you draw text to the screen, you keep track of a "current
    point" which is the origin of each character. The current point's vertical
    position is the baseline. Even "baked fonts" use this model.
  * Vertical Font Metrics: The vertical qualities of the font, used to
    vertically position and space the characters. See stbtt_GetFontVMetrics.
  * Font Size in Pixels or Points: The preferred interface for specifying font
    sizes in stb_truetype is to specify how tall the font's vertical extent
    should be in pixels. If that sounds good enough, skip the next paragraph.

    Most font APIs instead use "points", which are a common typographic
    measurement for describing font size, defined as 72 points per inch.
    stb_truetype provides a point API for compatibility. However, true
    "per inch" conventions don't make much sense on computer displays
    since different monitors have different number of pixels per inch. For
    example, Windows traditionally uses a convention that there are 96 pixels
    per inch, thus making 'inch' measurements have nothing to do with inches,
    and thus effectively defining a point to be 1.333 pixels. Additionally, the
    TrueType font data provides an explicit scale factor to scale a given font's
    glyphs to points, but the author has observed that this scale factor is
    often wrong for non-commercial fonts, thus making fonts scaled in points
    according to the TrueType spec incoherently sized in practice.

  @Detailed Usage)

 DETAILED USAGE:

 * Scale: Select how high you want the font to be, in points or pixels. Call
   ScaleForPixelHeight or ScaleForMappingEmToPixels to compute a scale factor SF
   that will be used by all other functions.

 * Baseline: You need to select a y-coordinate that is the baseline of where
   your text will appear. Call GetFontBoundingBox to get the baseline-relative
   bounding box for all characters. SF*-y0 will be the distance in pixels that
   the worst-case character could extend above the baseline, so if you want the
   top edge of characters to appear at the top of the screen where y=0, then you
   would set the baseline to SF*-y0.

 * Current point: Set the current point where the first character will appear.
   The first character could extend left of the current point; this is font
   dependent. You can either choose a current point that is the leftmost point
   and hope, or add some padding, or check the bounding box or left-side-bearing
   of the first character to be displayed and set the current point based on
   that.

 * Displaying a character: Compute the bounding box of the character. It will
   contain signed values relative to <current_point, baseline>. I.e. if it
   returns x0,y0,x1,y1,  then the character should be displayed in the rectangle
   from <current_point+SF*x0, baseline+SF*y0> to
   <current_point+SF*x1,baseline+SF*y1).

  * Advancing for the next character: Call GlyphHMetrics, and compute
    'current_point += SF * advance'.

  @bold(Advanced Usage)

  Quality:
  * Use the functions with <tt>Subpixel</tt> at the end to allow your characters
    to have subpixel positioning. Since the font is anti-aliased, not hinted,
    this is very important for quality. (This is not possible with baked fonts.)
  * Kerning is now supported, and if you're supporting subpixel rendering
    then kerning is worth using to give your text a polished look.

  Performance:
  * Convert Unicode codepoints to glyph indexes and operate on the glyphs;
    if you don't do this, stb_truetype is forced to do the conversion on
    every call.
  * There are a lot of memory allocations. We should modify it to take
    a temp buffer and allocate from the temp buffer (without freeing),
    should help performance a lot.

  @bold(Notes)

  The system uses the raw data found in the .ttf file without changing it
  and without building auxiliary data structures. This is a bit inefficient
  on little-endian systems (the data is big-endian), but assuming you're
  caching the bitmaps or glyph shapes this shouldn't be a big deal.

  It appears to be very hard to programmatically determine what font a
  given file is in a general way. I provide an API for this, but I don't
  recommend it. }

    AXOff, AYOff: output origin of the character

  Returns:
    A 2D array of bytes 0..255, AWidth * AHeight in size

  APixelDistScale & AOnEdgeValue are a scale & bias that allows you to make
  optimal use of the limited 0..255 for your application, trading off precision
  and special effects. SDF values outside the range 0..255 are clamped to
  0..255.

  Example:
    AScale = stbtt_ScaleForPixelHeight(22)
    APadding = 5
    AOnEdgeValue = 180
    APixelDistScale = 180/5.0 = 36.0

  This will create an SDF bitmap in which the character is about 22 pixels high
  but the whole bitmap is about 22+5+5=32 pixels high. To produce a filled
  shape, sample the SDF at each pixel and fill the pixel if the SDF value is
  greater than or equal to 180/255. (You'll actually want to antialias, which is
  beyond the scope of this example.) Additionally, you can compute offset
  outlines (e.g. to stroke the character border inside & outside, or only
  outside). For example, to fill outside the character up to 3 SDF pixels, you
  would compare against (180-36.0*3)/255 = 72/255. The above choice of variables
  maps a range from 5 pixels outside the shape to 2 pixels inside the shape to
  0..255; this is intended primarily for apply outside effects only (the
  interior range is needed to allow proper antialiasing of the font at *smaller*
  sizes)

  The function computes the SDF analytically at each SDF pixel, not by e.g.
  building a higher-res bitmap and approximating it. In theory the quality
  should be as high as possible for an SDF of this size & representation, but
  unclear if this is true in practice (perhaps building a higher-res bitmap and
  computing from that can allow drop-out prevention).

  The algorithm has not been optimized at all, so expect it to be slow if
  computing lots of characters or very large sizes. }

{ Finding the right font...

  You should really just solve this offline, keep your own tables of what font
  is what, and don't try to get it out of the .ttf file. That's because getting
  it out of the .ttf file is really hard, because the names in the file can
  appear in many possible encodings, in many possible languages, and e.g. if you
  need a case-insensitive comparison, the details of that depend on the encoding
  & language in a complex way (actually underspecified in truetype, but also
  gigantic).

  Parameters:
    ATtfData: pointer to the TTF data.
    AName: name of the font to find.
    AStyles: the font style(s) to search for.

  Returns:
    The offset (not index) of the font that matches, or -1 if not found.

  If AStyles is an empty set, then you must specify the exact font name with
  style designator (like 'Arial Bold'). Otherwise, use a font name without style
  designator (like 'Arial').

  This function will use @bold(case-sensitive) comparisons on unicode-encoded
  names to try to find the font you want. You can run this before calling
  stbtt_InitFont. }
function stbtt_FindMatchingFont(const ATtfData: Pointer;
  const AName: MarshaledAString; const AStyles: TStbttFontStyles): Integer; cdecl;
  external STB_LIB name _PU + 'stbtt_FindMatchingFont';

{ Lets you get any of the various strings from the TTF file yourself and do your
  own comparisons on them (possibly using stbtt_CompareUTF8toUTF16_bigendian).

  Parameters:
    AInfo: font information (acquired with stbtt_InitFont).
    ALength: is set to the length of the string.
    APlatform: the platform to use.
    AEncodingID: the encoding to use.
    ALanguageID: the language to use.
    ANameID: the name to use.

  Returns:
    The string (which may be big-endian double byte, e.g. for unicode). The
    length of the string is put in ALength.

  Some of the values for the IDs are defined as STBTT_* constants. For more see

{ Can be used to compare string returned by stbtt_GetFontNameString.

  Parameters:
    AUtf8String: pointer to a UTF-8 string.
    AUtf8Length: length of AUtf8String.
    AUtf16String: pointer to a big-endian UTF-16 string.
